          I run a code club at Victoria Avenue Library in Blackley, Manchester.


          Children from ages 9-13 are are welcome every other Saturday to learn
          about coding using the code club projects. We have a lot of fun
          exploring different ways of building games, programs and websites and
          even some programming of MicroBit and Raspberry Pi's.


          If you're interested in coming along the club runs on the following
          dates. Visit here for the next dates.
